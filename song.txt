I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause every time that she gets close, yeah
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessin', hmm
And maybe I should stop and start confessin'
Confessin', yeah

Oh, I've been shakin'
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
